# Basic JPG to PDF converter

## What is this?

I basically just want to get practice with git and put a bit of green on my heatmap. 
This is following a recent LinkedIn post that got recommended to me (yes, I'm on that
too, if you're hiring hit me up) from freeCodeCamp that I followed relatively quickly 
that can be found **[here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/convert-multiple-images-into-a-single-pdf-file-with-python/)**. 

There isn't any witchcraft or voodoo involved, just following along with the tutorial 
and figuring out a few things on my own (reminding myself with a Google search how to 
add environment variables (for img2pdf) to Windows (that was about it, actually)).

Anyway, enjoy.  The images were downloaded from **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)** as 
recommended in the tutorial.  They are all of waterfalls, because, why not?
